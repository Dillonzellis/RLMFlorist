                                    instance, if an order is for yellow daisies, they will substitute another color of
                                    daisies, not another yellow flower. White roses and cream roses may be substituted
                                    for each other as well as peach roses and pink roses. Purple and pink orchids may
                                    need to be substituted for white orchids and visa versa.
